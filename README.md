# Silicon Roundabout Ventures new JAMstack website

## Overview


## Stack used
 * Gridsome

### Gridsome infrastructure
`.vue` components in the `src/pages` directory create page routes. `gridsome build` generates static files in a `/dist` folder. [Here](https://gridsome.org/docs/core-concepts/) you can find the key concepts behind the gridsome architecture.


### Tools used

* text editor (Atom)
* terminal
* npm

### Dev Log

#### 1. Project setup:
  1. Installed the gridsome command line toolkit via `sudo npm install --global @gridsome/cli`
  2. Gridsome [project infrastructure](https://gridsome.org/docs/#how-to-install) created with `gridsome create gridsome-portfolio-site`, entered via `cd gridsome-portfolio-site`, and linked to github repo:
    1. `git init`
    2. `git remote add origin <Remote repository URL>`
    3. `git add .`
    4. `git commit -am "Gridsome setup"`
    5. `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`
    6. Conflicts merged appropriately
    7. `git push <remote> <branch>`
    * *Note: I made my life more difficult by wanting to merge an existing repo with basic files in it â”€I could have just made the repo locally and pushed it fresh to Github. It was totally useless to do what I did ;p*
  3. Gridsome local server started: `gridsome develop` (now I can check the site out on http://localhost:8080)
  4. Followed the [Create Page section here](https://stuffwelearned.com/blog/building-your-website-with-gridsome-a-complete-guide/#creating-pages) to set up and play around with the basic Gridsome framework

#### 2. Contentful setup and integration:
  1. Headed over to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), created a free account, and create a new space. You can create a new blank space, or use the "Blog" example space. For ease of use, I'll be choosing the blog example space. Spaces are where the Contentful webapp stores content. They are available at [app.contentful.com](https://app.contentful.com/)
  2. Install the [Contenful Gridsome plugin](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-contentful): `npm add @gridsome/source-contentful`
  3. In the root of the project, I added a file called `.env` to locally store the Contentful environmental variables that are unique to my space. To find these, I logged into Contentful and under `Settings >> API Keys` I could generate the environmental keys "Space ID", "Access Token", and "Environment" (defaults to "master"). Within the `.env` file, I added the following contents:
    ```
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE="<YOUR_CONTENTFUL_SPACE>"
    CONTENTFUL_TOKEN="<YOUR_CONTENTFUL_TOKEN>"
    CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT="<YOUR_CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT>"
    ```
    *Note: if you use this repo, you will need to create your own .env file and set up your own variables*
  5. Contentful is now set up and ready to be linked to your Gridsome site

### 3. Set up and integratre Tailwind CSS:
  1. Tailwind installed and initialised: `npm i tailwindcss`, `npx tailwind init`
  2. Global CSS file created in `src/assets/css` called `global.css` (folders under src manually created in the process, as a slight variation from the default Tailwind [setup for Vue](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite). File text:
  ```
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
  3. Imported .css file to `/main.js` by adding the line `import "./assets/css/global.css";`
  4. Added tailwind to gridsome by adding `const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss")` to `gridsome.config.js`
  5. Tailwind is now ready to kick butts on our site

#### 4. Link Contenful and Tailwind CSS to our gridsome site infrastructure:
  1. Edited `gridsome.config.js` to have the following project settings and plugin links:
  ```
  module.exports = {
    siteName: '<YOUR_SITE_NAME>',
    templates: {
     ContentfulBlogPost: '/blog/:slug'
    },
    plugins: [
      {
      use: "@gridsome/source-contentful",
        options: {
        space: process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE,
        accessToken: process.env.CONTENTFUL_TOKEN,
        host: "cdn.contentful.com",
        environment: process.env.CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT,
        typename: "Contentful"
      }
  }
  ],
   css: {
    loaderOptions: {
      postcss: {
        plugins: [
          tailwindcss
        ],
      },
    },
   }
  }
  ```
  2. **NOTE!**: Test that gridsome can build fine. If it fails, your problem might be PostCSS compatibility. ðŸš¨ If you get such errors, Tailwind has created a [compatibility version](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build). This means: (a) remove broken packages (`npm uninstall tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`) and (b)_reinstall the compatible verion (`npm install tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9 --force`). Once the rest of your tools have added support for PostCSS 8, you will be able to move off of the compatibility build by [re-installing Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using the latest tag](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build).

#### 5. Creating content (e.g. a Blog)
  1. Under the pages folder, added a file called `Blog.vue`.
  2. Filled blog with the [template](https://gridsome.org/docs/templates/) data and a basic element layout for the templated page:
  ```
  <template>
      <Layout>
      <div class="container grid grid-cols-1 justify-center px-auto mx-auto flex flex-wrap flex-col md:flex-row items-center ">
       <div class="mx-0 px-auto max-w-xl mx-auto">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-tight mb-6 mt-4 text-center text-primary">Blog</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="{ node } in $page.posts.edges" :key="node.id">
    <g-link :to="node.path">
       <div class=" border-solid border-2 border-primary max-auto-sm overflow-hidden shadow-lg p-20 m-4 rounded-md">
    <h1 class="text-2xl text-primary font-bold">  {{node.title}}  </h1>
    <p class="pt-5 text-darkgray"> {{node.description}} </p>
    <p class="font-normal text-sm pt-5 text-primary"> Posted on {{node.date}} </p>
    </div>
    </g-link>
      </li>

    </ul>

    </div>
    </div>
      </Layout>
    </template>

    <page-query>
    query Posts {
      posts: allContentfulBlogPost {
    edges {
      node {
        id,
        title,
        description,
        date (format: "MMMM DD, YYYY"),
        path

      }
    }
      }
    }
    </page-query>

    <script>
    export default {
      metaInfo: {
    title: 'Blog'
      }
    }
    </script>
  ```





### TODO

* At localhost:8080/blog you should see a listing of blogs (assuming you've added a published at least one in Contentful). Clicking on any of the blogs will yield no results just yet. This is because we need a way for gridsome to read our markdown from Contentful: e.g. add the tool "Markdown-It" via npm.
* Create our blog template.
* Modify our Default.vue layout and update the Index.vue page (aka, the home).
* Customizing our Header and Footer (Default.vue layout)
* Add a few modifications and styling
